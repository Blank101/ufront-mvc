  Fixes for Haxe 3.2-rc.2.
  Should remain compatible with 3.1.3 for now.
  Unit tests passing, pending fixes in some of our dependencies.  (Mockatoo, mconsole, detox etc).
  Add `UFAuthHandler.asAuthHandler()` to avoid variance issues.
  Add `SysUtil.recursiveDelete()`.
  Add `MultiValueMap.allValues()`.
  For each `HttpContext`, inject the context injector into itself.
  In ViewResult, when guessing view name from function name, don't guess 'cs.html' from 'docs()' or similar words - only remove the `do` prefix if the next character is uppercase.
  Work around for macro errors when using Mockatoo on a UFApi class.
  Many small unit testing improvements.
  Removed `HttpApplicationMacros` - it saved some lines of code but made it hard to understand and debug, and had limited usefulness elsewhere.
