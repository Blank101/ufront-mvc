  "releasenote": "Add `HttpRequest` and `HttpResponse` implementations for NodeJS, moving closer to NodeJS support. Still not tested.
Renamed `UFHttpSessionState` to `UFHttpSession`.
Change `HttpApplication.execute()` to require `HttpContext`.
Add `HttpApplication.executeRequest()` for Neko and PHP and `HttpApplication.listen()` for NodeJS.
Changes to `UFAuthHandler` interface to avoid variance issues, add `NobodyAuthHandler`.
`HttpContext.create()` is now `HttpContext.createSysContext()` and only available on Neko and PHP.
`HttpContext` now requires a parent injector, which is used to get `UFAuthHandler`, and `UFHttpSession`.
Use dependency injection for controllers, rather than having a typedef for controllers with no arguments to the constructor.
Use dependency injection for `UFAuthHandler`s and `UFHttpSession`s, rather than using factories.
Use dependency injection for `ViewEngine` configuration.
Add `defaultLayout` option to `UfrontConfiguration`
Many small fixes, documentation additions and code cleanups.",
